### **Validator Node Guide**

**Important Note**: This is the inaugural testnet launch. While we strive for perfection, there might be unforeseen issues. We appreciate all feedback, bug reports, or any other issues reported in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DJkcuy9SAg).

#### **Requirements**:
- **CPU**: 1 vCPU
- **Memory**: 1 GB RAM
- **Disk**: 50 GB HDD or higher
- **Open TCP Ports**: 8231, 8085
- **Open UDP Port**: 7621

#### **Setup on Ubuntu Server**:

1. **Update OS**: 
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install Java**: 
   ```bash
   apt install openjdk-19-jre-headless
   ```

3. **Install the validator node software and config file**:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/pwrlabs/PWR-Validator-Node/raw/main/validator.jar
   wget https://github.com/pwrlabs/PWR-Validator-Node/raw/main/config.json
   ```

4. **Set Up your Password**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano password
   ```
   - Enter your desired password.
   - Press `Ctrl + x` to close.
   - Press `Y` to confirm saving the password.
  
5. **Import Your Validator**:

   If you have a private key you want to import then use this command, otherwise skip to the next step.
   ```bash
   sudo java -jar validator.jar --import-key <private key here> password
   ```

6. **Run the Node**:

   Replace `<YOUR_SERVER_IP>` with your server's actual IP.
   ```bash
   sudo java -jar validator.jar password <YOUR_SERVER_IP> --compression-level 0
   ```
   PWR Chain is the first chain that supports block compression.
   --compression-level sets the level of compression you want your node to use.
   Compression level varies from 0 - 9. 0 disables compression. 9 sets it to maximum.

7. **Get Your Address**:
     ```
     curl localhost:8085/address/
     ```

9. **Become a Validator Node**:

   - Initially, your node will synchronize with the blockchain but will not assume validator responsibilities until it possesses staked PWR Coins.
   
   - To obtain sufficient PWR Coins for staking, [apply to become a testnet validator on our Discord server](https://discord.gg/DJkcuy9SAg). Once approved, you can use our discord bot to claim 100k PWR to stake.
   
   - After claiming your coins, your node will initiate a transaction to enlist as a validator.

10. **Running in the Background**:

    If you wish to run the node in the background, ensuring it remains active after closing the terminal, utilize the `nohup` command:
    ```bash
    nohup sudo java -jar validator.jar password <YOUR_SERVER_IP> --compression-level 0 &
    ```

11. **Getting Your Private Key**:
    ```bash
    nohup sudo java -jar validator.jar get-private-key password
    ```
    A hex string priate key will be returned. This key can be used in the [PWR Browser Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/u/3/detail/pwr-wallet/kennjipeijpeengjlogfdjkiiadhbmjl) 

Congratulations, you've now set up and run a PWR Chain validator node!
